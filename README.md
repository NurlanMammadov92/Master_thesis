# Master Thesis

This repository contains my master thesis materials where I replicated the analyses in the paper by Paye (2012) and extended the time 
series models of Paye (2012) by applying different theoretical framework MIDAS (Mixed Data Sampling) regressions.

All the programming of the models, analyses are implemented on programming language R and statistical software packages Eviews, Stata. Make sure to read the readme file on the data_manipulation_stata folder before proceeding to regression analyses.
